I am going to conduct a training on selling skills for the front-line sales associates. In this reflection, I will describe how I am going to apply the theories I have learnt in M1 of ACTA to my own training program.

### Learners' Profile

#### Defining Learners Profile

When designing training, it is important to know about learners. This is where learners' profile can play a role.

Learners' profile is a collection of information about the learners whom a training is catered for. What specific information is needed for creating a learners' profile may vary upon what the training is about. A typical learners' profile should include four components:

      - Demographics: such as age and sex
      - Cognitive level: language literacy, education level, working experience
      - Affective: attitude to learning and attitude as learner
      - Social: job category, career stage

There are a variety of ways to acquire information for the creation of learners' profile. We can conduct face-to-face interview ask questionss about learners. We can also use registration form to collect the necessary information about the learners. A corporate trainer may find it convenient to acquire the information by checking employee profiles with HR.

Below is the learners' profile I created for my training program.

      - Demographics
            - Age: 20s to 40s
            - Gender: 18 female, 1 male
            - Culture: 4 from China, 1 Philipine, 2 Myanmma, 6 Malaysia, 6 Singapore
            - Retail Experience: 1-7 years
      - Cognitive Characteristics
            - Language: Basic to intermediate English
            - Education: Mostly middle school level, a few diploma holders from overseas
            - Learning Styles: mix of AVK
      - Affective Characteristics
            - Motivation to Learn: most believe that the training is useless
            - Low Self-esteem: see themselves as underperforming staff
      - Social Characteristics
            - Job category: sales associates
            - Relationship to Peers: Unfamiliar with each other
            - From different outlets of the same company

#### Using Learners' Profile

Learners' profile is useful because it provides a clue for trainer to contextualize and customize the training so as to suit learners' needs, competencies, and learning styles. Take my training program as example. The learners are all sales associates from retail line, therefore, the learning outcomes of the training should be retail-specific. The selling skills that are specifically applicable to corporate sales would not be covered. To make the learning more relevent to the learners, I need to use scenarios, cases, and materials that are taken from retail environment to facilitate the learning.

The learners' profile also indicates learning barriers a learner may have. The barriers could be situational, institutional, or/and psychosocial. Situational barriers are obstacles as a result of personal life circumstances at a given point in time, such as transportation inconvenience, financial problem, busy work schedule. Institutional barriers are obstacles as a result of policies, practices, procedures, such as lack of necessary qualification, lack of employer support, lack of available courses. Psychosocial barriers are challenges as a result of one's own attitude and psychological state, such as lack of confidence, lack of trust in trainer, negative attitude toward learning.

The main barrier of my learners is that they have negative attitude to the learning. Most of them donot believe that the training can make any difference. They also feel embarrasing to attend as underperformers. Wlodkski's motivation theory provides insights for me to help the learners overcome their psychosocial barriers.

According to Wlodkski, learners will be motivated to participate in learning if the learning atmosphere is inclusive. To establish inclusion, I will, at the beginning of the first class, ask each of the learners to introduce themselves, listing what they like and dislike about doing retail sales. After that, I will ask them to find out what they can learn from whom. By doing so, the learners may feel that they will not feel like they are under-performers but respected as a person who has something to share with others in class.

Another strategy to motivate learner is to make the learning relevent to and meaningful for them. To this end, I will encourage the learners to share the challenges they have had at selling floor and show them how the skills they are going to learn in the class can help them earn more commission.

Moreover, I will organize the training sessions in sequence so that the learners can build up the competences in a step-by-step way. If they feel that they are making progress and achieving something, they will develop a sense of mastery and thus becoming more confident in the learning.

### Andragogy and Pedagogy
#### Characteristics of Adult Learners

It is important to understand that adults learn differently from children in many ways (Knowles 1988).

First, adults are self-directed learners. Unlike young learners who rely heavily on their teachers, adult learners are responsible for their decisions on learning. They therefore have psychological need to manage their own learning.

Second, adult learners have accumulated a wealth of experience that can serve as vital resource for their learning. Young learners, however, have little personal experience to present by defaul.

Third, adults are ready to start learning once they get to know why they need to learn something. Young learners, on the other hand, are usually told what they have to learn.

Fourth, adult learners are practical in learning. They prefer knowledge that can be immediately applicable to their professional needs, demanding that the learning is relevent to their real-life issues and able to boost their performance level. On the contrary, young learners' learning is more subject-centered.

Last, adult learners are responsive to intrinsic motivators such as self-esteem, quality of life, personal development, and the like. Therefore, compared to young learners who are motivated by extrinsic factors, adult learners are more satisfied with the learning process, more focused, more persistent, and more eager to apply their knowledge.

#### Faciliating Adult Learners

Accordingly, the trainers need to follow the andragogical principles, facilitating adult learners in ways that best suit the characteristics of adult learning. Firstly, the trainers should function like a resource person, providing tools and materials that the learners need to learn on their own, organizing group discussion for collaborative learning, and providing feedback on progress.

Secondly, the trainers should encourage the learners to share their personal expereince and design learning activities that help the learners to link the learning to their prior experience.

Thirdly, the trainers should help the learners to identify their needs to learn, organize the training sessions around the life-application categories,and sequence the sessions according to learners' readiness to learn.

Fourthly, the trainers should include more utilitarian contents for the learning and use techniques such as problem-solving cases to facilitate the learning.

Lastly, the trainers should explain to the learners why a particular lesson is being taught and how the participation in learning acitivities will benefit the learners.


### Adult Learning Theories

In Module one, I have learnt four theories about adult learning: Knowles's theory of self-directed learning, Mezirow's theory of transformational learning, Brookfield's theory of critical thinking, and Kolb's theory of experiential learning. These theories patternize the learning as processes through which learners can develop knowlege, skills, and attitude.

#### Applying Brookfield's Critical Thinking Framework
Brookfield's critical thinking model, for example, theorizes learning cycle as a five-step process:

      1. Trigger Event: An unexpected event causing perplexity and anxiety occurs
      2. Appraisal: Examine the situation and define the challenge
      3. Exploration: Explore different ways to resolve the problem
      4. Developing Alternative Perspective: Develop a new way of thinking
      5. Integration: Integrate the new development into life

This model can be applied to my training program. The audience of my training program is a group of underperforming sales associates. This audience has low level of self-efficacy in doing sales. One purpose of my program is to instil a can-do attitude in the audience. Below describes how I can apply Kolb's theory in my program.

To start, I will introduce a trigger event to the class by asking "Can you sell comb to a monk?". This question will cause anxiety for the learners because it challenges their assumption that a monk without hair does not need comb.

Then, I will ask the learners to reflect: What do you feel about "selling comb to monk"? Why we think that it is difficult? What the the assumptions behind your response? Are these assumptions accurate?

After that, organize a group discussion to explore the possible situations in which a comb can be useful for a monk. By doing this, the learners will be encouraged to check the accuracy of the assumption that a monk without hair does not need comb.

After they list out the possible ways to sell comb to monk, I will ask the learners to reflect on "how come selling comb to monk is no longer a challenge for them". I will guide them to reach the conclusion that there is a new approach to coping with challenges, that is, stop thinking why we can't do and start exploring what we can do.

In the end, I will ask them to apply this "explore what we can do" approach to the real challenge they have encountered at selling floor.

#### Applying Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory

The experiential model depicts the learning as a "process whereby knowlege is created through the transformation of experience". (Kolb, 1984) The process consists of four stages:

      1. Concrete Experience: the learners actively experience an acivity
      2. Critical Reflection: the learners reflect actively on what they have experienced
      3. Abstract Conceptualization: the learners try to conceptualize a pattern of what they have experienced or observed
      4. Active Experimentation: the learners try to apply the theory and plan for the forthcoming experience

This model emphasizes the importance of conceptualizing concrete experience and operationalizing the abstract concept. It is especially useful in guiding the learners to a complete understanding and application of a new concept.

I will apply this theory to help my learners understand the concept of "selling on benefits". Firstly, I will demonstrate two styles of selling in class: one style is to introduce the features of a product to customer, the other style is to explain how the customer can benefit from the product in real life situations.

Then, ask the learners to reflect on the two styles and explain why they feel that the second selling style is more convincing than the first style.

After that, ask the learners to discuss the differences between "selling on features" and "selling on benefits".

Last, divide the learners into groups, and give each group a list of features of a particulat product, then ask them to translate the features into benefits, and then ask the groups to demonstrate how they are going to sell th given product on benefits.


### Learning Styles
Dunn & Dunn identified four types of learning style: visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic style. Visual learning is learning by looking, auditory learning is learning by hearing, tactile learning is learning by writing, and kinesthetic learning is learning by doing.

It is important for trainers address different learning styles because most learners have their dominant or preferred learning styles. The learning styles I need to address in my program include visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Below explains the strategies to be used in my program to cater for different learning styles.

      1. Visual Learning Style
            - Use videos
            - Use slides to show what will be covered
            - Use images and colorful graphs, illustrations, diagrams
            - Give outlines, agendas, and handouts for learners to read
             Ask the learners to draw diagrams on white board
      2. Auditory Learning Style
            - Give oral introduction to new material
            - Encourage the learners to ask for verbal explanation
            - Include auditory activities such as debates, group discussion, and oral presentation
            - Conclude the class with an oral summary of what have been covered
      3. Kinesthetic Learning Styles
            - Use merchandises to illustrate
            - Provide simulation and role plays for learners to experiment
            - Provide opportunity for peer teaching and self-reflection

### Retention and Review Strategies
In addition to imparting the knowledge, trainers have to assist the learners in retaining the knowledge delivered to them. It has been found that instructional strategy has great impact on average retention rate. The instructional strategies that can actively engage the learners in learning will effectively increase retention rate as well. Some of the strategies that are proven effective in increasing retention rate are outlined as below:

      - Meaningful learning: link the new knowledge to the learners' prior experience
      - Primacy and recency: provide overview at the beginning and make a summary at the end
      - Rehearsal: repeat the learning points over and over again
      - Organization: find out logical connection among the learning points
      - Visual images: form a mental picture of the learning points
      - Elaboration: explain the new knowledge in more details

Below is how I am going to use the above mentioned strategies to help the learners to retain knowledge. The lesson is about "Handling Customer Objections".

<details>
<summary>Primacy and Recency </summary>
At the beginning of the class, I will provide an overview of the lesson by listing down the learning points to be covered. At the end of the class, I will ask the learners to summarize what they have learnt today.
