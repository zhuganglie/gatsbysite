### Applying Instructional Design Principles

First of all, I will organize the sessions in a way that reflects the natural process of doing sales. It will begin with "can-do attitude", followed by "approaching customer" and "identifying customer needs". After "presenting product" and "handling customer objection", the sessions will come to end at "closing sales".

Secondly, I will include a variety of techniques such as video, group discussion, brainstorming, didactic questioning, and role play to present learning materials. By doing this, I will create an engaging environment for active learning.

Thirdly, I will use the strategy of primary and recency to enhance the retention of learning. Learning outcomes will be presented at the beginning of each session, and a review of what have learnt will be presented at the end of each session.


### Components of Lesson Plan

Below is the lesson plan I developed for the 30 minutes facilitation:

### Learning Activities

Below is the note cards (Resource 3) developed for the learning activity of "identifying positivity and negativity".

**Activity instruction:**

1. Ask learners to come out to the open space and stand in circle
2. Ask learners to pick up one card from basket
3. Ask learners to read the stimuli and response on the note cards
4. Ask those who read negative response to move to trainer’s left side,
	and those who read positive response to move to trainer’s right side.
5. Debrief by asking what are the differences between positive attitude and negative attitude.


### Identify Training Needs

Our company has invested considerable effort into branding and marketing, but sales are still stagnant. Is this because the marketing strategy is not effective or because the sales force is not productive enough?

To figure out why sales remain stagnant, I did a survey in shops, counting how many visitors walked into shops and how many of them left the shops without making any purchase. After that, I did a field research in shops by observing how our sales associates perform their duty at the selling floor.

The findings of the research suggested that our frontline salespersons are lack of competence to convert walk-in customers into actual purchasers. Many salespersons have no can-do attitude. They don’t believe that they can make sales by exerting an influence on customer. Others don’t know how to start conversation with customers, how to sell benefits of products, how to respond to customer objections.

Based on the findings of the research, I put forward a proposal that a training on selling skills is needed to fill up the gap.

### Defining Learning Outcomes

Learning outcomes are the results that learners are going to achieve through learning. Learning outcomes must be clearly defined so that the learners will know in which domain (cognitive, affective, or psychomotor) and to which level their competences are to be enhanced. A clearly defined learning outcome should conform to the SMART criteria:

- Specific: Tell learners what exactly they will be able to do after learning.
- Measurable: A learning outcome must be an action that can be observed.
- Achievable: Learners must have a chance to complete.  
- Relevant: Learning outcomes must be important for learners to achieve.
- Time-bound: Tell learners when they are expected to achieve the outcomes.


Below is the learning outcomes I set for my lesson plan. The learning outcomes defined meet the SMART criteria.


After completion of the learning, learners will be able to:

1. explain 3 components of can-do attitude
2. demonstrate 3 steps of engaging customer


First of all, it specifies that the learners will learn “can-do attitude” and “engaging customer”. Second, “explain” and “demonstrate” are observable actions that can be used to measure weather the learners achieve the outcomes or not. According to Bloom’s taxonomy, “to explain” is at comprehension level of learning; and “to demonstrate” is at application level of learning. Third, “3 components” and “3 steps” indicate the extent to which the given outcomes will be achieved. Fourth, the skill of “can-do attitude” and skill of “engaging customer” are important for sales associates. Finally, the phrase “after completion of the learning” indicates the timeframe for learners to achieve the given learning outcomes.


### Identify 2 Stakeholders

There are 2 stakeholders who reviewed my training project. One stakeholder is the managing director of the company. Before facilitation, he reviewed my lesson plan and made a comment that the timeframe for the training should be extended from 6 hours to 12 hours. His concern is that the learners may not be able to master the skills if the training runs too fast.

The other stakeholder is the sales operation manager of the company. His concern is that the daily operation will be effected if more than 10 sales associates have to be absent from working for 2 days.

Taking their concerns into consideration, I made some adjustments to the lesson plan. First, I changed the arrangement of sessions from 6 hours in one day into 12 hours in 6 days. Second, the lesson plan was enriched with more learning activities. Third, I changed the venue from shop to meeting room so that the training sessions do not have to rush to end before 10:30am.

After the training was conducted, the two stakeholders reviewed the facilitation again.
The managing director commented that the training is well done in the sense that it enriched the sales associates with various techniques of doing sales. Nevertheness, whether the sales associates are able to apply what have learnt in the class to workplace remained unsure because the training provided insufficient guidance on how to apply those techniques to real-life situations.

This comment is pertinent. I did incorporate Gagne's step 9 and facilitated the transfer of learning by asking the learners to reflect on what they could do differently, but this is not enough because I did not check what difficulties they might have when applying a certain technique to different real-life situations. Next time, I need to enhance the transfer of learning. In addition to asking reflective questions, I will provide more role-plays incorporating situational challenges from different scenarios. After doing the role-plays, give specific feedback to each of the learners.

The sales operation manager's comment focused on the handouts. His point is that the learners may not be able to absorb all the techniques they have been taught in class. Therefore, it is necessary that we provide the learners with more easy-to-read handouts so that they could have something to refer back when they are asked to practice those techniques at workplace. And, it would be better if the handouts could be presented in both English and Chinese.

This comment reminds me that learning is not merely taking place in class but also after the class. As a committed trainer, I also need to cater for the learners' after class learning. Therefore, next time when I conduct the training, I will prepare bilingual handouts on each of the learning outcomes for my learners to review their learning after class.
